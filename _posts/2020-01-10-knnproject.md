# K-Nearest Neighbor

In this project (final project for principles of Data Science), I constructed a K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm from scratch using no libraries for the computation. The algorithm was tested on images of digits, and attempting to predict what number is written.

The main goal of this was to understand the mathematics behind "higher" level models and to not treat them as black boxes. While KNN is definitely simple in the grand scheme, the usage of linear algebra and matrices to measure distances is a very common theme among other machine learning algorithms.
