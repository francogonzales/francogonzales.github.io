This was the final (group) project for Big Data & High Performance Statistical Computing.

In this project, we were tasksed with picking any topic related to big data and performing some sort of analysis. Our group decided to take various types of classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Naive Bayes, etc and compare error rate with runtime. The question we asked was how much accuracy should we attempt to squeeze out before computational power becomes a bottleneck?

We collected different data sets containing features with various make-ups (continous, binary, discrete, etc) to see which algorithms performed better depending on the features. The links for dataset(s) are contained in the report itself.
