In this project, I used Python and its various libraries to compare three very common regression methods: Linear Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), random forest. I was curious how well hyper-parameter optimization affects model accuracy. In addition, how well do higher complexity algorithms compare to basic Linear Regression?

The data was used was housing data collected from Trulia using the BeautifulSoup package.

Important notes:

* I use Visual Studio Code instead of the traditional Jupyter Notebook
  * This is why .py are the formats of the code
  * The reason for the ## in the code is due to how the Jupyter package works in VScode (works as separate chunks)
  * Plots were saved using the built-in feature, hence why they weren't saved via a line of code.
